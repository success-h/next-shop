A NextjsbyExample Udemy course u took to help me understand all the basic to advanced features and uses of Nextjs Framework. In this course I learnt by example building two projects which we used tools like sanityCMS to handle our data and Nextjs for user interfaces covering all the advanced abilities of Nextjs like dynamic fetching, Protected routes, Authentications, APIs abilities and much more. I also learnt deeply about Nextjs built-in components, error handling and much more
